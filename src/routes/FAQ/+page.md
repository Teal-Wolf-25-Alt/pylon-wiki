# FAQ
- What is the server ip?
  - It is packaged in the CurseForge Profile. Just click "Join Pylon" or the "MP" button in the top left.
- I keep getting the "Connection Timed Out" error. How do I fix it?
  - Open the multiplayer menu (MP) and click refresh until you no longer see the motd, then while it is still loading the motd, try joining.
    - I have no idea why this works, it just does.
- The server is saying I am missing mods or am fatally missing entries but I am using the latest version of the pack on CurseForge. What's wrong?
  - If the pack has been updated but not approved on CurseForge yet you can find the latest one [here](https://cdn.tw25.net/mc/forge/1.12.2/pylon/cf-profile/latest.zip)
    - If you already have the latest version from the link above, make sure you are using the latest version of the Raw Power addon pack found in the server-files channel of the Discord. If you aren't, download it and put it in <gameDir>/addonpacks/
- I am not in the Discord server./I want to invite my friend to the Discord server.
  - The server invite is https://aka.tw25.net/pylon
- I see people with custom powers, why don't I have one?
  - To get a custom power, you must meet these requirements:
    - Be apart of the [Discord server](https://aka.tw25.net/pylon).
    - Obtain a superpower
    - be a member of the Minecraft server for at least 1 week/have 18 hours of play time on the server/get to xp level 75
      - This requirement doesn't apply to people with the Addon VIP role in the Discord.
